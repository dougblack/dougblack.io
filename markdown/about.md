### Hi! I'm Doug.

I'm interested in building things that solve big problems... and small ones too.

<!-- <p style="text-align: right; margin-top: -1em;">and small ones too.</p> -->

I've worked on the API at [Twilio](https://twilio.com){:target="_blank"}, the data platform at
[Discord](https://discord.com){:target="_blank"}, and recurring billing at
[Stripe](https://stripe.com){:target="_blank"}. I'm currently looking for
something new and interesting to work on.

I live in Denver, where I like to make music, ski powder, and build things.

You can find assorted side projects on my
[github](https://github.com/dougblack){:target="_blank"}. You can look at my running times from
years back on my
[tfrrs](https://www.tfrrs.org/athletes/2708303/Georgia_Tech/Doug_Black.html){:target="_blank"}.

I've written a couple of small blog [posts](words.html) over the years. Some
are a little embarassing to reread now, but I've left them up for posterity.

If you'd like to talk, [email me](mailto:doug@dougblack.io).
