                <h2>Programming</h2>
                <p>I began school as an Applied Mathematics major before realizing I was spending all of my free time programming so I switched to Computer Science. I believe this is one of the best decisions I've made in my life.</p>
                <p>I've built <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.doug.nextbus" target="blank">Android apps</a>, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/04/college-hackathon/" target="blank">won hackathons</a>, and now work on one of the best <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/rest" target="blank">RESTful API's</a> in the world.
                <p>I'm currently a maintainer on a few popular open source projects:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://github.com/flask-restful/flask-restful">flask-restful</a>: a RESTful framework in python</li>
                    <li><a href="https://github.com/atom/vim-mode">vim-mode</a>: a vim-emulation plugin for the atom text editor</li>
                    <li><a href="https://github.com/dougblack/sleepy">sleepy</a>: a RESTful micro-framework in go</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I've written a few things about programming. <a href="words.html">Check them out.</a></p>

                <h2>Running</h2>
                <p>I've spent a lot of time running. I started running in 7th grade, ran all through high school, and eventually spent four incredible years on the varsity Track and Field and Cross Country teams at Georgia Tech.</p>

                <h2>Skiing</h2>
                <p>Since moving to the San Francisco in 2013, I've discovered a
                new passion. Skiing is incredible, and simply getting out of
                the city and spending some time in the mountains is incredibly
                rejuvenating.</p>

                <p>One time I tried snowboarding. On my final run of my first
                day snowboarding, I caught an edge and landed hard on my
                shoulder. A trip to the ER, some heavy painkillers, and six
                weeks of recovery later the ligament attaching my right
                shoulder to my clavicle is still permanently severed. Probably
                not going snowboarding again for a while.</p>

                <p>I'm averaging right around 20 days a season, which I'm
                pretty proud of. It's a huge time investment, but it's
                completely worth it.</p>
