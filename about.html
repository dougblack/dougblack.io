            <div id="article">
                <p>Most recently, I was an engineer on the data infrastructure team at <a href="https://discordapp.com">Discord</a>.</p>
                <p>Previously, I was lead engineer on the API team at <a href="https://twilio.com">Twilio</a> and had a front row seat as we grew from 100 people to public company.</p>

                <p>Before I moved to San Francisco and then Denver, I grew up in North Carolina and went to school at Georgia Tech where I majored in Computer Science.</p>

                <h2>Programming</h2>
                <p>I began school as an Applied Mathematics major before realizing I was spending all of my free time programming so I switched to Computer Science. I believe this is one of the best decisions I've made in my life.</p>
                <p>Before Discord, I built <a href="https://dougblack.io/words/introducing-keylixer.html" target="blank">OS X apps</a>, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/04/college-hackathon/" target="blank">won hackathons</a>, and worked on one of the best <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/rest" target="blank">RESTful API's</a> in the world.
                <p>I've written a few things about programming. <a href="words.html">Check them out.</a></p>

                <h2>Running</h2>
                <p>I used to run a lot! I started running in 7th grade, ran all through high school, and eventually spent four incredible years on the varsity Track and Field and Cross Country teams at Georgia Tech.</p>
