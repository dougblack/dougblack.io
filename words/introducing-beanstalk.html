                <h1>Introducing Beanstalk: A Netrunner Discord Bot</h1>
<h4>Posted March 18, 2018</h4>

<h2>Discord</h2>
<p>A quick update: back in December I wrapped up a wonderful 4.5 years with
<a href="https://twilio.com">Twilio</a> and joined the awesome team at <a href="https://discord.com">Discord</a> as an
engineer on the Data Infrastructure team where we're currently focused on
scaling our data pipeline to keep up with Discord's rapid growth.</p>
<h2>Netrunner</h2>
<p>I recently started <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android:_Netrunner">Android: Netrunner</a>, an asymmetric two-player
tabletop card game. It's a beautiful, complex, high strategy card game that I
highly recommend! I convinced a few friends to join me and we were soon talking
about Netrunner quite frequently in our own private Discord server.</p>
<p>However, our conversations would frequently involve a particular card and
because both of us are new enough as to not have each of the 1400+ cards in the
entire card pool memorized, we'd both need to go look up the text of the card
on <a href="https://netrunnerdb.com">NetrunnerDB</a>, which is an incredible community resource
maintained by the prolific <a href="https://twitter.com/alsciende">@alsciende</a>.</p>
<p>Having to constantly context switch between our conversation and a card
reference was mildly annoying, so I merged two mutual interests and created a
Discord bot that reads from the <a href="https://netrunnerdb.com/api/doc">NetrunnerDB API</a> and responds
with card text inline to automate that process for us, much like
<a href="https://scryfall.com/">Scryfall</a> does for Magic on Discord and Slack and like
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MTGCardFetcher">MTGCardFetcher</a> does for the Magic subreddit.</p>
<h2>Discord + Netrunner = Beanstalk</h2>
<p>I named it Beanstalk. In the cyperpunk Netrunner universe, the
<a href="http://android-universe-fan.wikia.com/wiki/Beanstalk">Beanstalk</a> is a 70,000km tall space elevator that connects the
Ecuadorian megacity of New Angeles to Earth's orbit, revolutionizing the
world's economy.</p>
<p>Beanstalk's usage is simple. Simply put all or part of a card's name in double
square brackets and it will reply with the card's text in a nicely formatted
embed. For instance,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think [[Paperclip]] is broken</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="../assets/images/beanstalk-screen2.png"><img src="../assets/images/beanstalk-screen2.png" width="500"/></a></p>
<p>Alternatively, you can prefix the card text with an exclamation point and
Beanstalk will reply only with a full sized image of the card.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I like the flavor on [[!maxx]], quite rebellious.</p>
</blockquote>
