<h2 id="how-to-vimrc">How To Vimrc</h2>
<p>There is just one rule you must follow when crafting your own .vimrc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don't put any lines in your vimrc that you don't understand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are tons of tutorials such as this one on the internet
that contain all kinds of awesome hacks to make your Vim better, but
the absolute worst way to make your environment better is to just copy
it wholesale from others.</p>
<p>Spending the time to actually learn what's going into the construction
of your editor is invaluable. In the same way that copying notes off a
projector by hand often leads to increased information retention,
adding features one by one to your vimrc aids in overall Vim
comprehension.</p>
<p>With that said, the rest of this article will be me explaining each and
every line in my current vimrc in its entirety with the hope that you
will find some tricks you haven't seen before. But! My vimrc is far
from perfect. I'm always looking for additions that would make my
environment better so if you think I missed something important please
let me know: <a href="https://twitter.com/dougblackio">@dougblackio</a>.</p>
<p>I will break it up into logical sections.</p>

<p>This article will almost certainly fall out of date with my vimrc in the
very near future. You can find the most up to date version of it
<a href="https://github.com/dougblack/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc">on github</a>.</p>
<h2 id="colors"><a name="colors"></a>Colors</h2>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">colorscheme</span> badwolf         <span class="c">&quot; awesome colorscheme</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Colors! Colorschemes are subjective, but I've currently settled on
<a href="https://github.com/sjl/badwolf/">badwolf by Steve Losh</a>. I found <a href="https://github.com/altercation/Vim-colors-solarized.git">solarized</a>
incredibly complete, but a little too bland for my taste. I enjoy colors
that pop. I also spend a good deal of time with <a href="https://github.com/tomasr/molokai.git">molokai</a>
and still think it's a great scheme, but simply prefer badwolf at the
moment.</p>
<p>Moving on:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nb">syntax</span> enable           <span class="c">&quot; enable syntax processing</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The comment should be enough to describe this one. I'll take this
moment to plug adding comments to most if not every line in your vimrc.
If you're anything like me that file is going to get pretty long, and
chances are you won't remember what every line does forever, so adding
comments will help Future You know what the hell is going on in there.</p>
<p>Also, many settings in Vim have both a long name and a short name. For
instance <code>background</code> is the same as <code>bg</code>. For future readability, I
strongly recommend using the long name.</p>
<h2 id="spaces-tabs"><a name="spaces"></a>Spaces &amp; Tabs</h2>
<p>The incantations you must throw into your vimrc to get tabs/spaces
working the way you want can be pretty confusing, so here's a quick
refresher.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">tabstop</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="m">4</span>       <span class="c">&quot; number of visual spaces per TAB</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>tabstop</code> is the number of spaces a tab counts for. So, when Vim opens
a file and reads a <code>&lt;TAB&gt;</code> character, it uses that many spaces to visually
show the <code>&lt;TAB&gt;</code>.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">softtabstop</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="m">4</span>   <span class="c">&quot; number of spaces in tab when editing</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>softabstop</code> is the number of spaces a tab counts for <em>when editing</em>. So
this value is the number of spaces that is <em>inserted</em> when you hit
<code>&lt;TAB&gt;</code> and also the number of spaces that <em>are removed</em> when you
backspace.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">expandtab</span>       <span class="c">&quot; tabs are spaces</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>expandtab</code> turns <code>&lt;TAB&gt;s</code> into spaces. That's it. So <code>&lt;TAB&gt;</code> just
becomes a shortcut for "insert four spaces".</p>
<p>Taken together, these are great options for editing files in languages
that prefer spaces over tabs, since this ensures no <code>&lt;TAB&gt;s</code> are actually
used. I spend most of my day in python and bash, where spaces are
the norm. I like it, since it means my source code looks the same on
every machine.</p>
<h2 id="ui-config"><a name="ui"></a>UI Config</h2>
<p>These are options that change random visuals in Vim.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">set</span> <span class="k">number</span>              <span class="c">&quot; show line numbers</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Showing line numbers should need no justification.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">showcmd</span>             <span class="c">&quot; show command in bottom bar</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>showcmd</code> shows the last command entered in the very bottom
right of Vim. I have it set here but it's actually not shown
in my Vim since I use <a href="https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline">powerline</a> plugin (which
we will get to later).</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">cursorline</span>          <span class="c">&quot; highlight current line</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>cursorline</code> draws a horizontal highlight (or underline, depending on
your colorscheme) on the line your cursor is currently on. I've found
that this makes it easier to follow exactly what line you left off on
when you're switching back to a Vim session or switching between windows
in Vim.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">filetype</span> indent <span class="k">on</span>      <span class="c">&quot; load filetype-specific indent files</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This both turns on filetype detection and allows loading of language
specific indentation files based on that detection. For me, this
means the python indentation file that lives at
<code>~/.vim/indent/python.vim</code> gets loaded every time I open a <code>*.py</code> file.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">wildmenu</span>            <span class="c">&quot; visual autocomplete for command menu</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is a pretty cool feature I didn't know Vim had. You know how Vim
automatically autocompletes things like filenames when you, for instance,
run <code>:e ~/.vim&lt;TAB&gt;</code>? Well it will provide a graphical menu of all the
matches you can cycle through if you turn on <code>wildmenu</code>.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">lazyredraw</span>          <span class="c">&quot; redraw only when we need to.</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Vim loves to redraw the screen during things it probably doesn't need
to&mdash;like in the middle of macros. This tells Vim not to bother
redrawing during these scenarios, leading to faster macros.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">showmatch</span>           <span class="c">&quot; highlight matching [{()}]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>With <code>showmatch</code>, when your cursor moves over a parenthesis-like
character, the matching one will be highlighted as well.</p>
<h2 id="searching"><a name="search"></a>Searching</h2>
<p>I love Vim's search. I love it even more with the following settings.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">incsearch</span>           <span class="c">&quot; search as characters are entered</span>
<span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">hlsearch</span>            <span class="c">&quot; highlight matches</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>These should be pretty self explanatory. They make searching better.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c">&quot; turn off search highlight</span>
<span class="nb">nnoremap</span> <span class="p">&lt;</span>leader<span class="p">&gt;&lt;</span>space<span class="p">&gt;</span> :<span class="k">nohlsearch</span><span class="p">&lt;</span>CR<span class="p">&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Vim will keep highlighted matches from searches until you either run
a new one or manually stop highlighting the old search with <code>:nohlsearch</code>.
I find myself running this all the time so I've mapped it to <code>,&lt;space&gt;</code>.</p>
<h2 id="folding"><a name="fold"></a>Folding</h2>
<p>Vim folding is a pretty sweet feature that I don't make heavy use of,
but when I want it, I want it to have reasonable settings.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">foldenable</span>          <span class="c">&quot; enable folding</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Shows all folds.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">foldlevelstart</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="m">10</span>   <span class="c">&quot; open most folds by default</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>foldlevelstart</code> is the starting fold level for opening a new buffer.
If it is set to 0, all folds will be closed. Setting it to 99 would
guarantee folds are always open. So, setting it to 10 here ensures
that only very nested blocks of code are folded when opening a buffer.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">foldnestmax</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="m">10</span>      <span class="c">&quot; 10 nested fold max</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Folds can be nested. Setting a max on the number of folds guards against
too many folds. If you need more than 10 fold levels you must be writing
some Javascript burning in callback-hell and I feel very bad for you.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c">&quot; space open/closes folds</span>
<span class="nb">nnoremap</span> <span class="p">&lt;</span>space<span class="p">&gt;</span> za
</code></pre></div>

<p>I change the mapping of <code>&lt;space&gt;</code> pretty frequently, but this is its
current command. <code>za</code> opens/closes the fold around the current block.
As an interesting aside, I've heard the <code>z</code> character is used to
represent folding in Vim because it looks like a folded piece of paper.
Probably not, but it makes a nice story. :)</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">foldmethod</span><span class="p">=</span>indent   <span class="c">&quot; fold based on indent level</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This tells Vim to fold based on indentation. This is especially useful
for me since I spend my days in Python. Other acceptable values are
<code>marker</code>, <code>manual</code>, <code>expr</code>, <code>syntax</code>, <code>diff</code>. Run <code>:help foldmethod</code> to
find out what each of those do.</p>
<h2 id="movement"><a name="movement"></a>Movement</h2>
<p>Here we start getting into custom bindings. This group of bindings
all relate to movement commands.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c">&quot; move vertically by visual line</span>
<span class="nb">nnoremap</span> <span class="k">j</span> gj
<span class="nb">nnoremap</span> <span class="k">k</span> gk
</code></pre></div>

<p>These two allow us to move around lines visually. So if there's a very
long line that gets visually wrapped to two lines, <code>j</code> won't skip over
the "fake" part of the visual line in favor of the next "real" line.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c">&quot; move to beginning/end of line</span>
<span class="nb">nnoremap</span> B ^
<span class="nb">nnoremap</span> E $

<span class="c">&quot; $/^ doesn&#39;t do anything</span>
<span class="nb">nnoremap</span> $ <span class="p">&lt;</span>nop<span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="nb">nnoremap</span> ^ <span class="p">&lt;</span>nop<span class="p">&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>These feel like my most controversial bindings, since they overwrite
existing movement bindings. My thinking was that hitting <code>^</code> and <code>$</code> to
jump to the beginning and  end of a line was a little too uncomfortable
for such an oft-used movement. So I rebound <code>E</code> and <code>B</code>, which are
typically used to move forwards and backwards over visual words to these
purposes.  Next I bound the old way to <code>&lt;nop&gt;</code> to train myself to use
the new ones.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c">&quot; highlight last inserted text</span>
<span class="nb">nnoremap</span> gV `[<span class="k">v</span>`]
</code></pre></div>

<p>This one is pretty cool. It visually selects the block of characters you
added last time you were in <code>INSERT</code> mode.</p>
<h2 id="leader-shortcuts"><a name="leader"></a>Leader Shortcuts</h2>
<p>Here we've reached the meat of my custom keybindings. This section will
introduce many different plugins and custom functions that I use pretty
frequently. Let's get started.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">let</span> mapleader<span class="p">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;,&quot;</span>       <span class="c">&quot; leader is comma</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>\</code> is a little far away for a leader. I've found <code>,</code> to be a much
better replacement.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c">&quot; jk is escape</span>
<span class="nb">inoremap</span> jk <span class="p">&lt;</span>esc<span class="p">&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>&lt;ESC&gt;</code> is <em>very</em> far away. <code>jk</code> is a much better replacement as it's
on the home row and I actually never type it when writing text. Except
right now when I wrote this section of this post. Which I'm writing in
Vim. The workaround if you ever need to enter this rare sequence of
keys is to enter the <code>j</code>, wait for the leader-check timeout to fade,
and then enter the <code>k</code>.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c">&quot; toggle gundo</span>
<span class="nb">nnoremap</span> <span class="p">&lt;</span>leader<span class="p">&gt;</span><span class="k">u</span> :GundoToggle<span class="p">&lt;</span>CR<span class="p">&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In one of its cleverest innovations, Vim doesn't model undo as a simple
stack. In Vim it's a tree. This makes sure you never lose an action in
Vim, but also makes it much more difficult to traverse around that tree.
<a href="https://github.com/sjl/gundo.vim.git">gundo.vim</a> fixes this by displaying that undo tree in graphical form.
Get it and don't look back. Here I've mapped it to <code>,u</code>, which I like to
think of as "super undo".</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c">&quot; edit vimrc/zshrc and load vimrc bindings</span>
<span class="nb">nnoremap</span> <span class="p">&lt;</span>leader<span class="p">&gt;</span>ev :<span class="k">vsp</span> $MYVIMRC<span class="p">&lt;</span>CR<span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="nb">nnoremap</span> <span class="p">&lt;</span>leader<span class="p">&gt;</span>ez :<span class="k">vsp</span> <span class="p">~</span>/.zshrc<span class="p">&lt;</span>CR<span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="nb">nnoremap</span> <span class="p">&lt;</span>leader<span class="p">&gt;</span><span class="k">sv</span> :source $MYVIMRC<span class="p">&lt;</span>CR<span class="p">&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>These are shortcuts to edit and source my vimrc and my zshrc. That's
it.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c">&quot; save session</span>
<span class="nb">nnoremap</span> <span class="p">&lt;</span>leader<span class="p">&gt;</span>s :<span class="k">mksession</span><span class="p">&lt;</span>CR<span class="p">&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Ever wanted to save a given assortment of windows so that they're there
next time you open up Vim? <code>:mksession</code> does just that! After saving
a Vim session, you can reopen it with <code>vim -S</code>. Here I've mapped
it to <code>,s</code>, which I remember by thinking of it as "super save".</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c">&quot; open ag.vim</span>
<span class="nb">nnoremap</span> <span class="p">&lt;</span>leader<span class="p">&gt;</span><span class="k">a</span> :Ag
</code></pre></div>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher.git">The Silver Searcher</a> is a <em>fantastic</em> command line
tool to search source code in a project. It's wicked fast. The command line
tool is named <code>ag</code> (like the element silver). Thankfully there is a wonderful
Vim plugin <a href="https://github.com/rking/ag.vim.git">ag.vim</a> which lets you use <code>ag</code> without leaving Vim <em>and</em> pulls
the results into a quickfix window for easily jumping to the matches. Here I've
mapped it to <code>,a</code>.</p>
<h2 id="ctrlp"><a name="ctrlp-section"></a>CtrlP</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim.git">ctrlp.vim</a> is my life in Vim. If you've never used a fuzzy file
searcher this will open your eyes. If you're currently using
<a href="https://github.com/wincent/Command-T.git">commandt.vim</a>, you're on the right track, but CtrlP is the
spiritual successor. It's <em>can be</em> (see below) significantly faster and
more configurable than CommandT (Thanks <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/1vt4dg/a_good_vimrc/">Reddit</a>!). Anyways here
are my settings for CtrlP.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c">&quot; CtrlP settings</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="k">g</span>:ctrlp_match_window <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;bottom,order:ttb&#39;</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="k">g</span>:ctrlp_switch_buffer <span class="p">=</span> <span class="m">0</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="k">g</span>:ctrlp_working_path_mode <span class="p">=</span> <span class="m">0</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="k">g</span>:ctrlp_user_command <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;ag %s -l --nocolor --hidden -g &quot;&quot;&#39;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>There are a few things happening here. The first is I'm telling CtrlP to
order matching files top to bottom with <code>ttb</code>. Next, we tell CtrlP to
always open files in new buffers with <code>let ctrlp_switch_buffer=0</code>.
Setting <code>let g:ctrlp_working_path=0</code> lets us change the working directory
during a Vim session and make CtrlP respect that change.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about speed. CtrlP is entirely written in Vimscript,
(which is pretty impressive) but CommandT has parts that are written
in C. This means CommandT is, by default, faster than CtrlP. However,
we can tell CtrlP to run an external command to find matching files.
Now that we have <code>ag</code> installed, we can use it with CtrlP to make
CtrlP wicked fast.. We do that with the following.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">let</span> <span class="k">g</span>:ctrlp_user_command <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;ag %s -l --nocolor -g &quot;&quot;&#39;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>If everything works out, you should see a <em>noticeable</em> improvement
in the CtrlP speed. There are two caveats to this. Both
<code>g:ctrlp_show_hidden</code> and <code>g:ctrlp_custom_ignore</code> do not work with
custom user commands. I only care about the lack of support for custom
ignores. Thankfully, <code>ag</code> has it's own convention for ignore files:
a <code>.agignore</code> file that follows the same conventions as <code>.gitignore</code>.
This is actually great! We only need to define our directories to
ignore when searching in one place.</p>
<h2 id="launch-config"><a name="launch"></a>Launch Config</h2>
<p>These are options set at launch to configure external tools exactly once.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">call</span> pathogen#infect<span class="p">()</span>                      <span class="c">&quot; use pathogen</span>
<span class="k">call</span> pathogen#runtime_append_all_bundles<span class="p">()</span>  <span class="c">&quot; use pathogen</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>pathogen</code> options extract all of the Vim plugins
from their location in <code>~/.vim/bundles</code> to their respective places
in the <code>~/.vim</code> folder.</p>
<h2 id="tmux"><a name="tmux"></a>Tmux</h2>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c">&quot; allows cursor change in tmux mode</span>
<span class="k">if</span> exists<span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;$TMUX&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">let</span> &amp;<span class="nb">t_SI</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;\&lt;Esc&gt;Ptmux;\&lt;Esc&gt;\&lt;Esc&gt;]50;CursorShape=1\x7\&lt;Esc&gt;\\&quot;</span>
    <span class="k">let</span> &amp;<span class="nb">t_EI</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;\&lt;Esc&gt;Ptmux;\&lt;Esc&gt;\&lt;Esc&gt;]50;CursorShape=0\x7\&lt;Esc&gt;\\&quot;</span>
<span class="k">else</span>
    <span class="k">let</span> &amp;<span class="nb">t_SI</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;\&lt;Esc&gt;]50;CursorShape=1\x7&quot;</span>
    <span class="k">let</span> &amp;<span class="nb">t_EI</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;\&lt;Esc&gt;]50;CursorShape=0\x7&quot;</span>
<span class="k">endif</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>These lines change the cursor from block cursor mode to vertical bar
cursor mode when using tmux. Without these lines, tmux always uses
block cursor mode.</p>
<h2 id="autogroups"><a name="autogroup"></a>Autogroups</h2>

augroup END
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is a slew of commands that create language-specific settings for
certain filetypes/file extensions. It is important to note they are
wrapped in an <code>augroup</code> as this ensures the <code>autocmd</code>'s are only applied
once. In addition, the <code>autocmd!</code> directive clears all the <code>autocmd</code>'s
for the current group.</p>
<h2 id="backups"><a name="backup"></a>Backups</h2>
<p>If you leave a Vim process open in which you've changed file, Vim creates
a "backup" file. Then, when you open the file from a different Vim
session, Vim knows to complain at you for trying to edit a file that is
already being edited. The "backup" file is created by appending a <code>~</code> to
the end of the file in the current directory. This can get quite annoying
when browsing around a directory, so I applied the following settings
to move backups to the <code>/tmp</code> folder.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">backup</span>
<span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">backupdir</span><span class="p">=~</span><span class="sr">/.vim-tmp,~/</span>.tmp<span class="p">,~</span><span class="sr">/tmp,/</span>var<span class="sr">/tmp,/</span>tmp
<span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">backupskip</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="sr">/tmp/</span>*<span class="p">,</span><span class="sr">/private/</span>tmp/*
<span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">directory</span><span class="p">=~</span><span class="sr">/.vim-tmp,~/</span>.tmp<span class="p">,~</span><span class="sr">/tmp,/</span>var<span class="sr">/tmp,/</span>tmp
<span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">writebackup</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>backup</code> and <code>writebackup</code> enable backup support. As annoying as this
can be, it is much better than losing tons of work in an
edited-but-not-written file.</p>
<h2 id="custom-functions"><a name="functions"></a>Custom Functions</h2>
<p>I've written a small number of custom functions. Here they are with
comments explaining their purpose.</p>

<h2 id="organization"><a name="organization"></a>Organization</h2>
<p>Once your vimrc starts to fill up, organization becomes an issue. I've grouped
this article by logical sections. Not surprisingly, it makes sense to group
my actual vimrc by the exact same logical sections. Even cooler, Vim will
let us fold all of those sections up by default. So when you open your Vimrc
you have a high level view like this:</p>

</code></pre></div>

<p>Here's how we make that happen. First, we tell vim to fold sections
by <em>markers</em>, rather than <em>indentation</em>. That looks like this</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nb">foldmethod</span><span class="p">=</span>marker
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then we want it to close every fold by default so that we have this
high level view when we open our vimrc.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nb">foldlevel</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="m">0</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now, this is a file-specific setting, so we can use a <code>modeline</code> to
make Vim only use these settings for <em>this</em> file. Modelines are
special comments somewhere in a file that can can declare certain
Vim settings to be used only for that file. So we'll tell Vim
to check just the final line of the file for a modeline.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">set</span> <span class="nb">modelines</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="m">1</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Next, we'll add our modeline to the bottom of the file.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c">&quot; vim:foldmethod=marker:foldlevel=0</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Finally, we need to visually wrap each section in the fold marker.
The fold markers are <code>{{{</code> and <code>}}}</code>.That looks like this.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c">&quot; Section Name {{{</span>
<span class="k">set</span> <span class="k">number</span> <span class="c">&quot;This will be folded</span>
<span class="c">&quot; }}}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>That's it. I find this a great way to keep your vimrc highly structured,
easy to navigate, and incredibly readable.</p>
<h2 id="wrapping-it-up"><a name="wrap"></a>Wrapping It Up</h2>
<p>I hope this helped you. The reality is that this was a ton of stuff
and I still stand by this platitude:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don't put anything in your .vimrc you don't understand!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, if you grab lines from this, make sure you add comments explaining
exactly what is going on. If you can't, <code>:help [setting]</code> is your best
friend.</p>
